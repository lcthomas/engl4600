# Important Terms

Omeka is organized in a very modular way. We&#8217;re going to learn about the relevant technical details and how to use it in class on **Thursday, November 19**. But here are some basic definitions:

  * <a href="http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Items_2.0" target="_blank">Items</a> are the building blocks of any Omeka site. They are the objects and materials that Collections and Exhibits are made of. They might be photographs, documents, or other archival materials.
  * <a href="http://omeka.org/codex/Managing_Collections_2.0" target="_blank">Collections</a> are groups or buckets of items. They are a way to organize all of the Items related to your chosen dead writing technology in one place. In Omeka, each Item can only belong to one Collection.
  * <a href="http://omeka.org/codex/Plugins/ExhibitBuilder_3.0" target="_blank">Exhibits</a> are a way to interpret your Items and Collections. Exhibits are composed of pages, generally an initial page that introduces your exhibit and subsequent pages composed of the Items that you wish to highlight and/or relate to each other. Exhibits are made of already-added Items from the site&#8217;s various Collections. But unlike in Collections, an Item can belong to more than one Exhibit.
  * Metadata: Data that describes other data. Omeka employs the <a href="http://dublincore.org/documents/dces/" target="_blank">Dublin Core metadata element set</a>, a standard for libraries and museums.
