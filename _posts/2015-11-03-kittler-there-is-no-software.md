Kittler brings up a number of topics in the argument against the idea that we are still writing today. The first part of the argument appears when we dig into the idea of language and how we use the past to communicate. Old styles like Greek and Old European words like word and mind are used in word processing. Kittler sees this is revolutionary and as the beginning of the process in the actual execution of WordPerfect. Kittler references the Turing Machine in means to how modern computers work. If it weren’t for the movie I honestly would have no idea what this meant – it seems odd that Kittler would leave a small explanation out on the machine and the Church-Turning hypothesis. He makes a point with this to show how nature itself is a Turing machine – one program imitating another.

The idea that Kittler puts forward is the connection to software and mental property and mental cognition. This goes against the hypothesis of Alan Turing and in some places the idea has even been abandoned. The dispensability of hardware seems to be a major part of this switch over from Turings argument and hypothesis. We can argue both sides after the readings we’re observed in class. In Gallerie the program (book,writing) can from the software (online gargen, groups, collections). In this case the software and the mental property are indeed linked. In other readings like House of Leaves we saw that it was the software that influences the program and the programmer(s).

The “price of programmability” is a third topic that Kittler brings up in his argument about there no longer being software. Software, he argues, “if it existed, would be just a billion-dollar deal based on the cheapest elements on earth.” I now question when in time Kittler has come out with this piece. Without looking I can assume that it is fairly recent with the amount of gargen that he has included. In order for this kind of machine/technology to be built it would need to be able to reach a set of achievements in a limited class of behaviors.

In this piece, _There is no software_, there were a number of things that tripped be up when it came to understanding the similarities between technology and programming with writing. EXE, COM, DOS, WP, “eight bit file forms” and others mean nothing to me and are not a part of my regular vocabulary.

The mention of Silicon frequently throughout the piece tripped me up multiple times in its various meaning. I do not know the exact significance of silicon in technology and programming and to be honest even 100% in California to I understand it. I suppose this could contribute to the reason I am in this major/field. This argument seems to be lacking in some basic “_X_ for dummie” explanations.

If we are no longer writing, as Kittler argues on the first page, when would he argue this was completely true? Did it happen all at once or was is gradual. If it were gradual than couldn’t we say that we do both and will continue to do both?
