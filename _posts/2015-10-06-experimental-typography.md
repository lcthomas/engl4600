In Johanna Drucker&#8217;s &#8220;Experimental Typography as a Modern Art Practice,&#8221; she explores the different effects that typography can have. As she discusses &#8220;typographic enunciation,&#8221; she distinguishes between two main types of typography: marked and unmarked. Furthermore, Drucker&#8217;s focus is not solely on typography, but it is on typography as experiments conducted by avant-gardists of many different artistic expressions.

One main point that enhances Drucker&#8217;s argument is the foundational distinction she makes between &#8220;marked&#8221; and &#8220;unmarked&#8221; texts. In order to best explain this difference in typographic enunciation, Drucker refers to the invention of the printing press. She explains &#8220;unmarked&#8221; texts by giving the example of the printed bible. Drucker describes, &#8220;&#8230;perfectly uniform grey pages, their uninterrupted blocks of text, without headings or subheadings or any distraction beyond the occasional initial letter. These bibles are the archetype of the unmarked text&#8230;&#8221; (95). Drucker then contrasts the bible&#8217;s unmarkedness with the Indulgences&#8217; markedness. However, Drucker does more here than just provide examples of these two different typographic enunciations, she explains the effects that the differences in enunciation had/have on the reader and the greater society as a whole. The bible was printed with an unmarked enunciation, which allows the text to &#8220;possess an authority which transcends the mere material presence of words&#8230;&#8221; (95). On the other hand, the Indulgences, which utilized different fonts and different font sizes in order to &#8220;hierarchize information, to create an order in the text so that different parts appear to &#8216;speak&#8217; differently&#8230;&#8221; (95).

The aforementioned distinction then allowed Drucker to build on her argument by categorizing most unmarked texts as literary and most marked texts as advertising. Drucker&#8217;s utilization of the four different graphic advertisements allowed the reader to see a visual representation of how fonts, font size, layout, etc. can be used in a way to manipulate the reader/audience to focus on certain things or to evoke certain feelings or responses from the reader/audience. Drucker notes, &#8220;In this case, an element inserted on the diagonal breaks up the horizontal linear text, creating an air of unsettledness&#8221; (102).

I&#8217;m not super familiar with Dada and Futurist cultures, so I&#8217;m not sure that I completely understand some of the references and further implications that Drucker&#8217;s insights seem to have relating to Dada and Futurist cultures.

Also, I did have to refamiliarize myself with the term and movements of the &#8220;avant-garde&#8221; in order to better understand exactly what Drucker was talking about. Although I still may not fully understand the depth of importance that this has for her article, I do believe that trying to learn more about anything and everything &#8220;avant-garde&#8221; helped me to better understand what Drucker was trying to say.

When thinking about the many different fonts, utilizations of page space, pictures, colors, and absence of color in _House of Leaves, _in what kinds of ways is Mark Z. Danielewski trying to manipulate the reader (other than the ways that we have discussed in class already, i.e. labyrinthian reading experience)?
